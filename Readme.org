As I was planning to start job hunting, again, I had the idea of gathering LinkedIn data. My goal was having data of companies to sort, so I can prioritize which to contact... as well as doing some analysis.

As I was scraping Google map I discover that 2.7% of all records I have, are of businesses located in the middle of the sea; out of these 2.7%, 73% businesses share the same coordinates [46.423669, -129.9427086]

I was, indirectly, working for an influencer marketing agency, and I automated a manual task by enriching a database.

My "task" was visit a YouTube channel from a list on a platform called Noxinfluencer, and do a manual check.
Once a channel meet the criteria, I had to manually copy some information to a master Google Sheet.

I made this script when I was looking for a job, I needed a list of companies to contact, but also a way to prioritize who to contact first because of the email sending limitations.

As I collected the data from Google map, I kept enhancing it by adding data from the government of CA, and WHOIS; and I did some analysis at the end.

Example of the email I sent is in the webpage.

An interviewer tasked me with this: "Find out how NSW Govt run tenders for marketing projects"
I had, and still have, no idea on how to do so; but from what I understand, the marketing agency wants work on government projects.

I though, maybe if we initiate an interaction with someone and the government, persuade them to think that our service is good, we could get some favoritism.

So, I went to find one of the high officials, extract as much as I can about him and their surrounding.

After joining a Zoom call on data evaluations, I decided to start a project based on the subject we talked about: reducing fatalities in New York.
I took a large dataset from FARS website, cleaned it, and analyze it.

This project utilizes the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) model to enhance marketing strategies for different customer segments.
Customer Examples
- Customer A: Recently shopped, purchased 10 items, spent $250.
- Customer B: Last shopped long ago, purchased 2 items, spent $1,000.

Marketing Strategies

For Customer A, we will send coupons to encourage repeat purchases. For Customer B, who has a history of buying high-value items, we will showcase our new line of premium products to re-engage them effectively. This targeted approach ensures relevant communications that drive sales.
